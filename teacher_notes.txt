 
Basic  Descriptive  Statistics  (Notes)
 
1.  Data  Basics  
Understanding  data  is  the  cornerstone  of  statistics.  Data  is  the  raw  material  that  we  analyze  to  
extract
 
insights,
 
make
 
decisions,
 
and
 
build
 
models.
 
To
 
truly
 
master
 
this
 
concept,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
explore
 
it
 
in
 
depth.
  
1.1  Types  of  Data  
Data  can  be  classiﬁed  into  two  main  categories:  Categorical  and  Numerical  .  Each  category  has  
subtypes,
 
and
 
understanding
 
these
 
distinctions
 
is
 
critical
 
for
 
choosing
 
the
 
right
 
statistical
 
methods
 
and
 
visualizations.
 
1.1.1  Categorical  Data  
Categorical  data  represents  categories  or  labels  .  These  categories  do  not  involve  numerical  values  
but
 
describe
 
qualitative
 
attributes.
 ●  Nominal  Data  :  ●  Categories  have  no  inherent  order.  ●  Examples:  ●  Colors:  Red,  Blue,  Green  ●  Marital  Status:  Single,  Married,  Divorced  ●  Cities:  New  York,  London,  Tokyo  ●  Key  Characteristics:  ●  Cannot  perform  mathematical  operations  (e.g.,  "Red  +  Blue"  makes  no  sense).  ●  Often  summarized  using  frequency  counts  or  percentages.  ●  Ordinal  Data  :  ●  Categories  have  a  meaningful  order  or  ranking.  ●  Examples:  ●  Education  Levels:  High  School,  Bachelor’s,  Master’s,  Ph.D.  ●  Movie  Ratings:  Poor,  Average,  Good,  Excellent  ●  Survey  Responses:  Strongly  Disagree,  Disagree,  Neutral,  Agree,  Strongly  
Agree
 ●  Key  Characteristics:  ●  Order  matters,  but  the  differences  between  categories  are  not  necessarily  
equal.
 ●  For  example,  the  difference  between  "High  School"  and  "Bachelor’s"  is  
not
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
the
 
difference
 
between
 
"Master’s"
 
and
 
"Ph.D."
 ●  Can  summarize  using  medians  or  modes,  but  not  means.   Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   
 1.1.2  Numerical  Data  
Numerical  data  represents  quantitative  measurements  and  involves  numbers.  It  can  be  further  
divided
 
into
 
discrete
 
and
 
continuous
 
data.
 ●  Discrete  Data  :  ●  Represents  countable  values.  ●  Examples:  ●  Number  of  students  in  a  classroom:  25,  30,  40  ●  Number  of  cars  in  a  parking  lot:  10,  15,  20  ●  Number  of  goals  scored  in  a  soccer  match:  0,  1,  2,  3  ●  Key  Characteristics:  ●  Values  are  whole  numbers  (integers).  ●  Finite  or  countably  inﬁnite  set  of  possible  values.  ●  Continuous  Data  :  ●  Represents  measurable  values  that  can  take  any  value  within  a  range.  ●  Examples:  ●  Height:  1.75  m,  1.80  m,  1.85  m  ●  Weight:  68.5  kg,  70.2  kg,  72.1  kg  ●  Temperature:  23.5°C,  24.1°C,  25.0°C  ●  Key  Characteristics:  ●  Values  can  include  decimals  or  fractions.  ●  Inﬁnite  number  of  possible  values  within  a  range.   
1.2  Variables  
A  variable  is  a  characteristic  or  attribute  that  can  take  different  values.  Variables  are  used  to  
represent
 
data
 
and
 
are
 
central
 
to
 
statistical
 
analysis.
 
Types  of  Variables  
1.  Independent  Variable  :  ●  The  variable  that  is  manipulated  or  controlled  in  an  experiment.  ●  Example:  ●  In  a  study  examining  the  effect  of  hours  studied  on  exam  scores:  ●  Independent  Variable:  Hours  studied.  ●  Dependent  Variable:  Exam  scores.  2.  Dependent  Variable  :  ●  The  variable  that  is  being  measured  or  observed.  ●  Example:  ●  In  the  same  study:  ●  Dependent  Variable:  Exam  scores.  3.  Confounding  Variable  :  
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   
 ●  A  variable  that  affects  both  the  independent  and  dependent  variables,  potentially  
causing
 
misleading
 
results.
 ●  Example:  ●  In  the  same  study:  ●  Confounding  Variable:  Prior  knowledge  of  the  subject  (students  who  
already
 
know
 
the
 
material
 
may
 
score
 
higher
 
regardless
 
of
 
hours
 
studied).
  
1.3  Populations  vs.  Samples  
Understanding  the  distinction  between  populations  and  samples  is  crucial  for  statistical  inference.  ●  Population  :  ●  The  entire  group  of  individuals  or  items  that  you’re  interested  in  studying.  ●  Example:  ●  All  students  in  a  university.  ●  All  adults  in  a  country.  ●  Sample  :  ●  A  subset  of  the  population  that  is  selected  for  analysis.  ●  Example:  ●  100  students  randomly  chosen  from  the  university.  ●  1,000  adults  surveyed  from  the  country.  
Why  Use  Samples?  
●  Studying  an  entire  population  is  often  impractical  due  to  time,  cost,  or  logistical  
constraints.
 ●  Statistical  techniques  allow  us  to  generalize  ﬁndings  from  a  sample  to  the  population.   
Examples  to  Understand  Data  Basics  
Example  1:  Classifying  Data  Types  
Classify  the  following  data  as  categorical  (nominal/ordinal)  or  numerical  (discrete/continuous):  1.  Favorite  ice  cream  ﬂavor  (chocolate,  vanilla,  strawberry).  2.  Number  of  books  read  in  a  year.  3.  Temperature  in  degrees  Celsius.  4.  Education  level  (high  school,  bachelor’s,  master’s,  Ph.D.).  Solution  :  1.  Categorical  (Nominal)  :  Ice  cream  ﬂavors  have  no  inherent  order.  2.  Numerical  (Discrete)  :  The  number  of  books  is  countable.  3.  Numerical  (Continuous)  :  Temperature  can  take  any  value  within  a  range.  4.  Categorical  (Ordinal)  :  Education  levels  have  a  meaningful  order.

Example  2:  Identifying  Variables  
In  a  study  examining  the  effect  of  exercise  on  weight  loss:  ●  What  is  the  independent  variable?  ●  What  is  the  dependent  variable?  Solution  :  ●  Independent  Variable  :  Amount  of  exercise  (manipulated  by  the  researcher).  ●  Dependent  Variable  :  Weight  loss  (measured  outcome).   
Example  3:  Population  vs.  Sample  
A  researcher  wants  to  study  the  average  income  of  all  adults  in  a  country  but  only  surveys  1,000  
adults.
 ●  What  is  the  population?  ●  What  is  the  sample?  Solution  :  ●  Population  :  All  adults  in  the  country.  ●  Sample  :  The  1,000  adults  surveyed.   
 
Exercises  for  Practice  
Exercise  1:  Classify  the  Data  
Classify  the  following  data  as  categorical  (nominal/ordinal)  or  numerical  (discrete/continuous):  1.  Marital  status  (single,  married,  divorced).  2.  Number  of  cars  in  a  parking  lot.  3.  Time  taken  to  complete  a  race.  4.  Ratings  of  a  movie  (poor,  average,  good,  excellent).  Answers  :  1.  Categorical  (Nominal)  :  Marital  status  has  no  inherent  order.  2.  Numerical  (Discrete)  :  The  number  of  cars  is  countable.  3.  Numerical  (Continuous)  :  Time  can  take  any  value  within  a  range.  4.  Categorical  (Ordinal)  :  Movie  ratings  have  a  meaningful  order.   
Exercise  2:  Identify  Variables  
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   
 In  a  study  examining  the  relationship  between  hours  of  sleep  and  test  performance:  ●  What  is  the  independent  variable?  ●  What  is  the  dependent  variable?  Answers  :  ●  Independent  Variable  :  Hours  of  sleep  (manipulated  by  the  researcher).  ●  Dependent  Variable  :  Test  performance  (measured  outcome).   
Exercise  3:  Population  vs.  Sample  
A  researcher  wants  to  study  the  average  height  of  all  adults  in  a  country  but  only  surveys  1,000  
adults.
 ●  What  is  the  population?  ●  What  is  the  sample?  Answers  :  ●  Population  :  All  adults  in  the  country.  ●  Sample  :  The  1,000  adults  surveyed.   
 
Detailed  Explanation  of  Key  Concepts  
Why  Is  Classifying  Data  Important?  
Understanding  the  type  of  data  helps  you  choose  the  right  statistical  methods  and  visualizations.  
For
 
example:
 ●  Categorical  data  is  often  summarized  using  frequency  tables  and  bar  charts.  ●  Numerical  data  can  be  analyzed  using  measures  like  mean,  median,  and  standard  deviation.  
 
 
Why  Distinguish  Between  Population  and  Sample?  
In  most  cases,  it’s  impractical  to  study  an  entire  population  (e.g.,  all  adults  in  a  country).  Instead,  
we
 
analyze
 
a
 
sample
 
and
 
use
 
statistical
 
techniques
 
to
 
generalize
 
ﬁndings
 
to
 
the
 
population.

2.  Descriptive  Statistics:  A  Beginner-Friendly  Guide  
Descriptive  statistics  is  the  foundation  of  understanding  data.  It  helps  us  summarize  and  describe  
the
 
main
 
features
 
of
 
a
 
dataset
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that’s
 
easy
 
to
 
interpret.
 
We’ll
 
cover:
 1.  Measures  of  Central  Tendency  :  Mean,  Median,  Mode  2.  Measures  of  Dispersion  :  Range,  Variance,  Standard  Deviation,  Interquartile  Range  (IQR)  3.  Data  Visualization  :  Histograms,  Box  Plots,  Scatter  Plots  Let’s  explore  each  topic  in  extreme  detail,  step  by  step.     
2.1  Measures  of  Central  Tendency  
These  measures  tell  us  where  the  "center"  or  "typical  value"  of  the  data  lies.  They  are  essential  
because
 
they
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
single
 
number
 
that
 
represents
 
the
 
entire
 
dataset.
 
Think
 
of
 
them
 
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
summarize
 
the
 
data
 
without
 
looking
 
at
 
every
 
single
 
number.
 
2.1.1  Mean  (Average)  
The  mean  is  the  most  commonly  used  measure  of  central  tendency.  It’s  like  ﬁnding  the  "balance  
point"
 
of
 
the
 
data.
  What  Is  the  Mean?  ●  The  mean  is  the  sum  of  all  values  divided  by  the  total  number  of  values.  ●  Formula:                  
Step-by-Step  Calculation  :  ●  Add  up  all  the  numbers  in  the  dataset.  ●  Divide  the  sum  by  the  total  number  of  numbers.  Why  Use  the  Mean?  Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   
 ●  The  mean  considers  every  data  point,  so  it  gives  a  good  overall  picture  of  the  dataset.  ●  However,  the  mean  is  sensitive  to  outliers  (extreme  values).  For  example,  if  one  person  
earns
 
$1
 
million
 
in
 
a
 
group
 
of
 
people
 
earning
 
$50,000,
 
the
 
mean
 
income
 
will
 
be
 
skewed
 
upward.
   
  
  
2.1.2  Median  
The  median  is  the  middle  value  when  the  data  is  sorted  in  ascending  order.  It’s  like  ﬁnding  the  
"middle
 
child"
 
in
 
a
 
family.
 What  Is  the  Median?  ●  If  the  dataset  has  an  odd  number  of  values,  the  median  is  the  middle  value.  ●  If  the  dataset  has  an  even  number  of  values,  the  median  is  the  average  of  the  two  middle  
values.

    Step-by-Step  Calculation  :  ●  Sort  the  data  in  ascending  order.  ●  Find  the  middle  value(s).   Why  Use  the  Median?  ●  The  median  is  robust  to  outliers.  Even  if  there  are  extreme  values,  the  median  remains  
stable.
 ●  Example:  In  income  data,  the  median  gives  a  better  sense  of  what  a  "typical"  person  earns  
compared
 
to
 
the
 
mean.
   Example  :  
Let’s
 
calculate
 
the
 
median
 
for
 
the
 
dataset:
 
[5,10,15,20]
.
 
1.
 
Sort
 
the
 
data
 
(already
 
sorted):
 
[5,10,15,20]
.
 2.  Since  there  are  4  values  (even  number),  take  the  average  of  the  two  middle  values:

2.1.3  Mode  
The  mode  is  the  value  that  appears  most  frequently  in  the  dataset.  It’s  like  ﬁnding  the  "most  
popular"
 
item.
  What  Is  the  Mode?  The  mode  is  useful  for  identifying  the  most  common  value  in  a  dataset.   A  dataset  can  have:  ●  One  mode  (unimodal),  ●  More  than  one  mode  (bimodal,  multimodal),  or  ●  No  mode  if  no  value  repeats.   Why  Use  the  Mode?  ●  The  mode  is  helpful  for  categorical  data  (e.g.,  favorite  colors,  shoe  sizes).  ●  It’s  less  commonly  used  for  numerical  data  unless  there’s  a  clear  peak.   Example  :  
Let’s
 
ﬁnd
 
the
 
mode
 
for
 
the
 
dataset:
 
[5,10,10,15,20]
.
 Count  the  frequency  of  each  value:  
●

:
 
2
 
times
 
●
 
15
:
 
1
 
time
 
●
 
20
:
 
1
 
time
 
The
 
mode
 
is
 
10
 
(appears
 
twice).
   Real-World  Example  :  ●  Imagine  you’re  a  store  manager  analyzing  shoe  sizes  sold  in  a  week.  The  sizes  are  
[7,8,8,9,10,10,10]
.
 
The
 
mode
 
is:
 
Mode=10
  This  tells  you  that  size  10  is  the  most  popular  shoe  size.   Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved

The
 
mode
 
is
 
15
 
(appears
 
twice).
    
2.2  Measures  of  Dispersion  
These  measures  tell  us  how  spread  out  the  data  is.  They  are  crucial  because  they  give  us  a  sense  of  
variability
 
in
 
the
 
dataset.
   
2.2.1  Range   
The  range  is  the  simplest  measure  of  dispersion.  It’s  like  measuring  the  "width"  of  the  data.   What  Is  the  Range?  ●  The  range  is  the  difference  between  the  maximum  and  minimum  values.  ●  Formula:  
●
 
Range=Max−Min  
Why  Use  the  Range?  ●  The  range  gives  a  quick  sense  of  the  spread  of  the  data.  ●  However,  it’s  sensitive  to  outliers  because  it  only  considers  the  extremes.   Example  :  
Let’s
 
calculate
 
the
 
range
 
for
 
the
 
dataset:
 
[5,10,15,20]
.
 
●
 
Maximum:
 
20  
●
 
Minimum:
 
5  ●  Range:  
●
 
Range=20−5=15  
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   
  Real-World  Example  :   Imagine  you’re  analyzing  daily  temperatures  over  a  week.  The  temperatures  are  
[60,65,70,75,80]
.
 
The
 
range
 
is:
 
●
 
Range=80−60=20  
This  tells  you  the  temperature  ﬂuctuated  by  20  degrees  during  the  week.   Exercise  :   
Calculate
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
the
 
dataset:
 
[8,12,15,20,25]
.
  Solution:  
●
 
Maximum:
 
25  
●
 
Minimum:
 
8  ●  Range:  25  -  8  =  17  
 
 
2.2.2  Variance  
The  variance  measures  how  far  each  number  in  the  dataset  is  from  the  mean.  It’s  like  measuring  
the
 
"average
 
distance"
 
of
 
each
 
data
 
point
 
from
 
the
 
center.
   
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   
 
   
  Why  Use  Variance?   ●  Variance  tells  us  how  much  the  data  points  vary  from  the  mean.  ●  Larger  variance  indicates  greater  variability.    
Example  :  
Let’s
 
calculate
 
the
 
variance
 
for
 
the
 
dataset:

Exercise
 
:
 
Compute
 
the
 
variance
 
of
 
the
 
dataset:
 
[8,12,15,20,25]
.
  Solution:   
  Real-World  Example  :  Imagine  you’re  analyzing  the  daily  sales  of  a  store  over  ﬁve  days:  
[8,12,15,20,25]
.
 
The
 
variance
 
of
 
35.6
 
tells
 
you
 
that
 
the
 
sales
 
ﬁgures
 
vary
 
signiﬁcantly
 
around
 
the
 
mean
 
of
 
16
.
 
This
 
could
 
indicate
 
inconsistent
 
customer
 
traffic
 
or
 
ﬂuctuating
 
demand.
  
2.2.3  Standard  Deviation  
The  standard  deviation  is  simply  the  square  root  of  the  variance.  It  measures  the  spread  of  the  
data
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
units
 
as
 
the
 
original
 
data,
 
making
 
it
 
easier
 
to
 
interpret
 
than
 
variance.
  What  Is  Standard  Deviation?  Standard  deviation  quantiﬁes  how  much  individual  data  points  
deviate
 
from
 
the
 
mean.
  
  
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   

 Why  Use  Standard  Deviation?  Unlike  variance,  which  is  expressed  in  squared  units,  standard  
deviation
 
is
 
expressed
 
in
 
the
 
original
 
units
 
of
 
the
 
data.
 
It’s
 
widely
 
used
 
in
 
ﬁelds
 
like
 
ﬁnance,
 
quality
 
control,
 
and
 
machine
 
learning
 
to
 
measure
 
variability.
  Example  :  
Let’s
 
calculate
 
the
 
standard
 
deviation
 
for
 
the
 
dataset:
 
[5,10,15,20]
.
 
●
 
From
 
earlier,
 
we
 
calculated
 
the
 
variance
 
as
 
31.25
.
 ●  Take  the  square  root  of  the  variance:    Example  :   
Let’s
 
calculate
 
the
 
standard
 
deviation
 
for
 
the
 
dataset:
 
[5,10,15,20]
.
  
  
 
2.2.4  Interquartile  Range  (IQR)  
The  interquartile  range  (IQR)  is  the  range  between  the  ﬁrst  quartile  (Q1)  and  the  third  quartile  
(Q3).
 
It
 
represents
 
the
 
middle
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
and
 
is
 
robust
 
to
 
outliers.
  What  Is  the  IQR?  The  IQR  is  the  difference  between  Q3  (the  75th  percentile)  and  Q1  (the  25th  
percentile).
 
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   

   
Formula:
 
IQR= Q 3− Q 1   Step-by-Step  Calculation  :  ●  Sort  the  data  in  ascending  order.  ●  Find  Q1  (the  median  of  the  lower  half)  and  Q3  (the  median  of  the  upper  half).  ●  Subtract  Q1  from  Q3.   Why  Use  the  IQR?  ●  The  IQR  is  robust  to  outliers  because  it  only  considers  the  middle  50%  of  the  data.  ●  It’s  often  used  alongside  box  plots  to  identify  outliers.

2.3  Data  Visualization  
Visualizations  help  us  understand  patterns,  trends,  and  outliers  in  the  data.  They  make  complex  
datasets
 
easier
 
to
 
interpret.
  
2.3.1  Histograms  
A  histogram  shows  the  distribution  of  numerical  data  by  dividing  it  into  bins  (intervals).   What  Is  a  Histogram?  A  histogram  groups  data  into  bins  and  shows  the  frequency  (count)  of  
values
 
in
 
each
 
bin.
 
It
 
helps
 
visualize
 
the
 
shape
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
(e.g.,
 
symmetric,
 
skewed).
  Why  Use  Histograms?  Histograms  reveal  the  overall  pattern  of  the  data  and  identify  outliers.   Example  :  
Let’s
 
create
 
a
 
histogram
 
for
 
the
 
dataset:
 
[5,10,15,20,  29,  21,  15,  14,  9,  6,  35,  31,  11]
.
 
●
 
Choose
 
bins:
 
[0–10],[10–20]  [20-30],  [30  -40]
.

2.3.3  Scatter  Plots  
A  scatter  plot  shows  the  relationship  between  two  numerical  variables.  Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   

  A  scatter  plot  is  a  powerful  tool  for  visualizing  the  relationship  between  two  numerical  variables.  
It
 
helps
 
us
 
identify
 
trends,
 
correlations,
 
and
 
patterns
 
in
 
the
 
data.
  Why  Use  Scatter  Plots?  ●  Scatter  plots  are  particularly  useful  when  you  want  to  explore  whether  two  variables  are  
related.
 ●  They  can  reveal:  ●  Positive  Correlation  :  As  one  variable  increases,  the  other  tends  to  increase.  ●  Negative  Correlation  :  As  one  variable  increases,  the  other  tends  to  decrease.  ●  No  Correlation  :  No  clear  relationship  between  the  variables.   Step-by-Step  Process  :  ●  Identify  the  two  variables  you  want  to  compare.  ●  Plot  each  data  point  on  a  graph,  where:  ●  The  x-axis  represents  one  variable.  ●  The  y-axis  represents  the  other  variable.  ●  Look  for  patterns  or  trends  in  the  plotted  points.   Example  :  Let’s  create  a  scatter  plot  for  hours  studied  vs.  exam  scores:   Dataset:  
[
(2,
 
60),
 
(4,
 
80),
 
(6,
 
90),
 
(8,
 
95),
 
(1,
 
55),
 
(3,
 
70),
 
(5,
 
85),
 
(7,
 
92),
 
(9,
 
98),
 
(2.5,
 
65),
 
(3.5,
 
75),
 
(5.5,
 
88),
 
(7.5,
 
93),
 
(10,
 
100),
 
(1.5,
 
58),
 
(4.5,
 
82),
 
(6.5,
 
91),
 
(8.5,
 
96)
 
]   Interpretation:  ●  As  hours  studied  increase,  exam  scores  tend  to  increase  as  well.  ●  This  suggests  a  positive  correlation  between  study  time  and  performance.

Skewness  and  Kurtosis  These  are  measures  of  the  shape  of  the  data  distribution.  While  we’ve  discussed  measures  
like
 
mean,
 
median,
 
and
 
standard
 
deviation,
 
skewness
 
and
 
kurtosis
 
provide
 
deeper
 
insights
 
into
 
how
 
the
 
data
 
is
 
distributed.
 
1.1  Skewness  
What  Is  Skewness?  Skewness  measures  the  asymmetry  of  the  data  distribution.   A  symmetric  distribution  (like  the  normal  distribution)  has  zero  skewness.  
    
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   

 
  Positive  skewness:  The  tail  on  the  right  side  is  longer  (data  is  skewed  to  the  right).  
       
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   

 
Negative  skewness:  The  tail  on  the  left  side  is  longer  (data  is  skewed  to  the  left).  
  Why  Use  Skewness?  ●  Skewness  helps  identify  whether  the  data  is  evenly  distributed  or  if  it  has  a  long  tail  
on
 
one
 
side.
 ●  It’s  particularly  useful  when  deciding  whether  to  use  the  mean  or  median  as  a  
measure
 
of
 
central
 
tendency.
 ●  Example  :  
●
 
Dataset:
 
[5,10,15,20,100]  
●
 
Mean:
 
30
,
 
Median:
 
15  
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   

 
●  The  mean  is  much  larger  than  the  median,  indicating  positive  
skewness.
  Real-World  Example  :  Income  data  often  has  positive  skewness  because  a  small  number  
of
 
people
 
earn
 
extremely
 
high
 
incomes,
 
pulling
 
the
 
mean
 
upward.
 
 
1.2  Kurtosis  
●  What  Is  Kurtosis?  ●  Kurtosis  measures  the  "tailedness"  or  "peakedness"  of  the  data  distribution.  ●  High  kurtosis:  The  distribution  has  heavy  tails  and  a  sharp  peak  (leptokurtic).  ●  Low  kurtosis:  The  distribution  has  light  tails  and  a  ﬂatter  peak  (platykurtic).  ●  Normal  distributions  have  a  kurtosis  value  of  3  (often  adjusted  to  0  for  
simplicity).
 ●  Why  Use  Kurtosis?  ●  Kurtosis  helps  identify  whether  the  data  has  extreme  outliers  or  is  tightly  
clustered
 
around
 
the
 
mean.
 ●  Example  :  
●
 
Dataset:
 
[5,10,15,20,100]  
●
 
The
 
presence
 
of
 
the
 
extreme
 
value
 
(
100
)
 
suggests
 
high
 
kurtosis.
 
●  Real-World  Example  :  ●  Stock  market  returns  often  exhibit  high  kurtosis  due  to  occasional  extreme  
price
 
movements.

2.  Weighted  Mean  
The  weighted  mean  is  a  variation  of  the  mean  that  accounts  for  different  weights  assigned  
to
 
data
 
points.
 
This
 
is
 
useful
 
when
 
some
 
values
 
are
 
more
 
important
 
than
 
others.
  Formula:   
 
 
3.  Percentiles  and  Quartiles  
We  brieﬂy  touched  on  quartiles  (Q1,  Q2,  Q3)  earlier,  but  let’s  expand  on  percentiles  ,  which  
divide
 
the
 
data
 
into
 
100
 
equal
 
parts.
 ●  What  Are  Percentiles?  
●
 
The
 
p
-th
 
percentile
 
is
 
the
 
value
 
below
 
which
 
p %
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
falls.
 
●  For  example,  the  50th  percentile  is  the  median.  ●  Why  Use  Percentiles?  
Created  by  Shailesh https://beginnersblog.org & Openailearning   |  All  rights  reserved   

 
●  Percentiles  are  useful  for  understanding  the  relative  position  of  a  data  point  
within
 
the
 
dataset.
 ●  Common  percentiles  include:  ●  25th  percentile  (Q1)  ●  50th  percentile  (Median)  ●  75th  percentile  (Q3)  ●  Example  :  
●
 
Dataset:
 
[10,20,30,40,50]  
●  20th  percentile:  The  value  below  which  20%  of  the  data  falls.  
●
 
Position:
 
0.2 ⋅ ( n +1)=0.2 ⋅ 6=1.2  
●
 
Interpolate
 
between
 
the
 
1st
 
and
 
2nd
 
values:
 
10+0.2 ⋅ (20−10)=12  
●  Real-World  Example  :  ●  Standardized  test  scores  (e.g.,  SAT,  GRE)  are  often  reported  in  percentiles  to  
show
 
how
 
a
 
student
 
performed
 
relative
 
to
 
others.

4.  Outliers  
Outliers  are  extreme  values  that  deviate  signiﬁcantly  from  the  rest  of  the  data.  Identifying  
and
 
handling
 
outliers
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
part
 
of
 
descriptive
 
statistics.
 ●  What  Are  Outliers?  ●  Outliers  can  be  identiﬁed  using:  ●  Z-scores:  Values  more  than  3  standard  deviations  from  the  mean.  
●
 
IQR
 
Method:
 
Values
 
outside
 
[ Q 1−1.5 ⋅ IQR, Q 3+1.5 ⋅ IQR]
.
 
●  Why  Handle  Outliers?  ●  Outliers  can  skew  measures  like  the  mean  and  variance,  leading  to  misleading  
conclusions.
 ●  They  may  indicate  errors  in  data  collection  or  rare  events  worth  investigating.  ●  Example  :  
●
 
Dataset:
 
[5,10,15,20,100]  
●  Using  the  IQR  method:  
●
 
Q1:
 
10
,
 
Q3:
 
20
,
 
IQR:
 
10  
●
 
Lower
 
Bound:
 
10−15=−5  
●
 
Upper
 
Bound:
 
20+15=35  
●
 
100
 
is
 
an
 
outlier.
 
●  Real-World  Example  :  ●  In  ﬁnancial  data,  outliers  might  represent  fraudulent  transactions  or  market  
anomalies.

5.  Coefficient  of  Variation  (CV)  
The  coefficient  of  variation  is  a  relative  measure  of  dispersion  that  compares  the  standard  
deviation
 
to
 
the
 
mean.

2.4  Why  Descriptive  Statistics  Matters  
Now  that  we’ve  covered  measures  of  central  tendency,  dispersion,  and  visualization,  let’s  take  a  
moment
 
to
 
reﬂect
 
on
 
why
 
descriptive
 
statistics
 
is
 
so
 
important.
  ●  Summarizing  Large  Datasets  :  Real-world  datasets  often  contain  thousands  or  even  
millions
 
of
 
data
 
points.
 
Descriptive
 
statistics
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
summarize
 
this
 
information
 
into
 
a
 
few
 
key
 
numbers
 
or
 
visualizations,
 
making
 
it
 
easier
 
to
 
understand.
 ●  Identifying  Patterns  and  Trends  :  By  calculating  measures  like  the  mean,  median,  and  
standard
 
deviation,
 
we
 
can
 
quickly
 
identify
 
the
 
"center"
 
and
 
"spread"
 
of
 
the
 
data.
 
Visualizations
 
like
 
histograms
 
and
 
scatter
 
plots
 
help
 
us
 
spot
 
trends
 
and
 
relationships.
 ●  Making  Informed  Decisions  :  Descriptive  statistics  provides  the  foundation  for  
decision-making.
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
business
 
might
 
use
 
the
 
mean
 
and
 
standard
 
deviation
 
of
 
sales
 
data
 
to
 
set
 
targets
 
or
 
identify
 
underperforming
 
products.
 ●  Preparing  for  Advanced  Analysis  :  Before  diving  into  advanced  statistical  techniques  like  
hypothesis
 
testing
 
or
 
machine
 
learning,
 
it’s
 
crucial
 
to
 
ﬁrst
 
understand
 
the
 
basic
 
characteristics
 
of
 
your
 
data
 
using
 
descriptive
 
statistics.
